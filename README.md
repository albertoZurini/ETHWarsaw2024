# Crypto PoS

**Web3-ready Point of Sale system for cryptocurrency transactions using NFC technology.**  
Supports transactions on **Optimism Sepolia, Ethereum Sepolia, Celo, Celo cUSD, and Zircuit Testnet**.

## Overview

Crypto PoS offers a contactless payment experience using NFC (Near Field Communication) for fast and secure cryptocurrency transactions. Designed for merchants and users alike, it simplifies crypto payments by leveraging NFC tags/cards, providing a seamless and intuitive payment process.

With **Crypto PoS**, you can choose between two main protocols:

1. **Card Emulation Mode**  
   In this mode, the PoS shares address, chain ID, and transaction amount with a phone, which then processes the transaction. The PoS listens for on-chain transactions to confirm the payment using BlockScout's API.

2. **NFC Card Mode**  
   Users can load balance onto an NFC card and transfer funds by simply tapping it on the PoS. While this mode offers convenience, the current implementation lacks robust security measures like transaction signing, as it requires a custom smartcard. Future improvements aim to enhance security.

The system supports tax reporting by utilizing **DBForest** to store transaction data and **zkVerify** to generate zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring privacy when reporting the total amount handled.

## Features

- **NFC Contactless Payments**  
  Enables tap-to-pay cryptocurrency transactions with NFC tags or cards.
  
- **Multi-chain Support**  
  Transactions can be made on multiple networks: Optimism Sepolia, Ethereum Sepolia, Celo Alfajores, Celo cUSD ERC20, and Zircuit Testnet.
  
- **ENS Integration**  
  Displays ENS (Ethereum Name Service) information for added trust in transactions.
  
- **Invoice Generation**  
  Merchants can generate invoices using **Request Network**.
  
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**  
  zkVerify integration for secure and private transaction reporting.

## Problem it Solves

QR-based crypto payments, while useful, can be unreliable due to scanning issues. Crypto PoS offers a more reliable and user-friendly contactless alternative. With NFC technology, users can complete payments without relying on QR codes, enhancing convenience and speed.

Moreover, Crypto PoS aims to simplify tax reporting by using zero-knowledge proofs to share only the total amount of transactions handled, avoiding the need to disclose individual transactions to authorities.
